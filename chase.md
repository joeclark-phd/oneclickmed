Chase Flinn test page

Changes in the newest version include:
Creating the list of item categories and importing them to the website
We created and implemented item categories utilizing samples from www.dotmed.com and their auction listings. One level of subcategories currently exists within the design.
Ability to add new item listings
Creating a new item listing is simple as can be. Simply fill out the fields displayed on the create listing page, and a new listing will be uploaded onto the website. There is also the option of having a featured image to show as a thumbnail when searching.
Creating a functioning menu, integrating the OneClickMed homepage
The menu displayed at the top of the auctions website currently links to almost all of OneClickMed's desired pages, such as blog posts, social media, archives of medical directories, and the latest news and reports involving OneClickMed.
Restructuring the layout of the auctions home page
The website design in v.02 felt very clunky and boxy. The new layout is a sleeker and cleaner look and hopes to be more user-friendly.
