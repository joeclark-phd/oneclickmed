<b>Charles Bostick's Proposal for Verifyapp</b>

Verifyapp is a consumer-friendly tool that helps businesses plan and market
their websites in a way that receives customer feedback instantaneously.
 
Verifyapp works by uploading website mockups and giving feedback via design surveys.
It erases the worry and stress compared to hypothesizing and using guesswork to design
a website. There is a strong variety of tests available through Verifyapp, including,
but not limited to, Preference Tests, Yes/No Tests, Click Tests, Memory Tests, and a lot more.

A great thing about Verifyapp is that is can be up and running in just minutes of when you
want to use it. It uses screenshots of the website layout so the only code needed is the code
for the actual website design, nothing else! It's very easy to get started, and they have
several different pricing plans available depending on the size of the business and the
functionality wanted.

This informational tool could be a lifesaver in the development of a website, such as
the auction website we are currently creating.
