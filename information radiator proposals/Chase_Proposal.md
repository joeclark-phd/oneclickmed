For my proposal to Oneclickmed as a way to measure outputs from their websites is a popular tool for wordpress websites called Google analytics. 
Google analytics is a tool that measures all kinds of traffic metrics for one’s website.  Google analytics calls these measurements “Audience Overview” 
which measures unique visitors, average duration of visit, percent of new visits, bounce rate (people who just came looked and left) and more.  

There is also a tool called Traffic Source which measures where the traffic to the website is coming from whether its search engines, links from other 
websites or people coming directly to their website. 

Another very useful tool for Oneclickmed would be the pages tool for measuring what content and pages see the most activity. Since Oneclickmed is an auction, 
website it would be very useful to see what items or categories a majority of their customers are visiting or even more importantly what they are visiting, 
but choosing not to purchase. 

Another cool feature that Google analytics offers is great data visualizations to represent the data it obtains from your website.  Google presents the
information in a very easy to understand manner so almost anybody can comprehend what is happening on their website without looking up how to interoperate 
the information. 

Google analytics will be quite easy for Oneclickmed to install as well. It is made available as a Wordpress plugin so that it only takes a few hours to start running. 
All one needs to do is go to http://www.google.com/analytics/why/convert.html and create an account with Google analytics, and then shortly after code will be sent 
that would need to be entered into the wordpress theme. Another option is purchasing Google Analytics+ for $19 that provides a direct plugin for wordpress that does not 
require manually entering in code and editing theme files. 

There are actually quite a few different variations and ways to install Google Analytics to a website that can be found here as well:
