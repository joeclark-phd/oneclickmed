<b>WassUp Plugin Proposal</b>

Since the OneClickMed site works entirely off the use of WordPress, using a plugin is the easiest way
to bring helpful information to our client.

WassUp works with wordpress to bring real time analytics to our client. The plugin allows the user to 
view visitor activity so that they can learn nearly everything about what the visitors do on their site, as well as 
telling the user how many visitors there are in real time.

The setup for WassUp is simple, easy, and won't effect the data that is present in the databases. All
that needs to be done is downloading the plugin, unpackaging it, uploading the directory to the clients
host server, and activating the plugin on the WordPress administrator page. The time and resources that 
implementing this solution would take would be minuscule.

The plugin itself works from the clients WordPress dashboard and displays an informative graph, as well as other tickers, 
with pertinent information about the sites visitors such as referrers, search engines used, the pages the visitor
viewed, and much more. All of this information could be helpful to the OneClickMed team from assistance with search engine
optimization to ad targeting.
